At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem to solve: evaluate the product of four cube roots multiplied together. It's written as \u221a[3]{12} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{20} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{15} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{60}. Hmm, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that when you multiply cube roots, you can combine them under a single cube root. Let me try to recall the properties of radicals.\n\nI think the rule is that \u221a[n]{a} \u00d7 \u221a[n]{b} = \u221a[n]{a \u00d7 b}. So, in this case, since all of them are cube roots, I can multiply all the numbers inside the roots together and then take the cube root of the product. That should simplify things a lot.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\u221a[3]{12} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{20} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{15} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{60} = \u221a[3]{12 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 60}\n\nAlright, so now I just need to compute the product inside the cube root. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 12 and 20. 12 \u00d7 20 is 240. Okay, so that gives me 240.\n\nNext, multiply that result by 15. So, 240 \u00d7 15. Let me calculate that. 240 \u00d7 10 is 2400, and 240 \u00d7 5 is 1200, so adding those together gives 2400 + 1200 = 3600. So, 240 \u00d7 15 = 3600.\n\nNow, multiply 3600 by 60. Hmm, 3600 \u00d7 60. Well, 3600 \u00d7 6 is 21,600, and then times 10 is 216,000. So, 3600 \u00d7 60 = 216,000.\n\nSo now, the product inside the cube root is 216,000. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to \u221a[3]{2",

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should write down what f(x) is. So, f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3)(x - 7)(x - 9). It's a quartic polynomial, which means it's a fourth-degree polynomial. I know that when you have a product of linear factors like this, it's a straightforward way to write the polynomial. But calculating f(6) and f(4) directly might be a bit tedious, especially since I have to multiply four terms each time. Maybe there's a smarter way to do this without expanding the entire polynomial.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with polynomials, especially when evaluating at specific points, it can be helpful to see if there's a symmetry or a pattern in the roots. The roots of f(x) are 1, 3, 7, and 9. Let me write those down: 1, 3, 7, 9. Hmm, those numbers look like they could be paired in a way that might help. Let me see: 1 and 9 add up to 10, and 3 and 7 also add up to 10. Interesting, so each pair adds to 10. That seems significant.\n\nSo, if I think about f(x), it's a product of (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d) where a, b, c, d are 1, 3, 7, 9. Since the roots are symmetric around 5 (because 1 and 9 average to 5, and 3 and 7 average to 5 as well), the polynomial might have some symmetry. Maybe f(5 + t) relates to f(5 - t) in some way.\n\nBut I need to find f(6) and f(4). Let's see where 6 and 4 are located with respect to the roots.\n\nFor x = 6: Let's subtract 5 from each root:\n\n6 - 5 = 1\n\n3 - 5 = -2\n\n7 - ",
