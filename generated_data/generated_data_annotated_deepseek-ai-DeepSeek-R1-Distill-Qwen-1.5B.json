At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many vertical asymptotes the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has. Hmm, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? Because the function will approach infinity or negative infinity as it gets close to those x-values. So, I should start by finding the roots of the denominator.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\). To find its roots, I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first because it might be quicker. I need two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Let's see, 3 and -2: 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as \\( (x + 3)(x - 2) \\).\n\nTherefore, the denominator is zero when \\( x + 3 = 0 \\) or \\( x - 2 = 0 \\), which gives x = -3 and x = 2. So, the function has vertical asymptotes at x = -3 and x = 2. That means there are two vertical asymptotes.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I plug x = -3 into the denominator, it becomes \\( (-3)^2 + (-3) - 6 = 9 - 3 - 6 = 0 \\). Similarly, for x = 2, it's \\( 2^2 + 2 - 6 = 4 + 2 - 6 = 0 \\). Yep, both are zeros of the denominator, so vertical asymptotes at these points.\n\nIs there any other possibility? Maybe I should consider if the numerator and denominator share any common factors, which could lead to holes instead of asymptotes. The numerator is just 2, which doesn't factor into anything. So, no, there are no common factors, meaning both x = -3 and x = 2 are indeed vertical asymptotes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has two vertical asymptotes at x = -3 and x = 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe graph has \\boxed{2} vertical asymptotes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many vertical asymptotes the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has, we need to find the roots of the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\).\n\nFirst, we factor the quadratic equation:\n\\[ x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe roots of the denominator are found by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\\[ x + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3 \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2 \\]\n\nSince the numerator is 2, which does not share any common factors with the denominator, both \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\) are vertical asymptotes.\n\nThus, the graph has \\boxed{2} vertical asymptotes.",

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the positive difference between 120% of 30 and 130% of 20. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a percentage means per hundred, so 120% is the same as 120 per 100, or 120/100. Similarly, 130% is 130/100. Maybe I can convert these percentages into decimals to make the calculations easier. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with 120% of 30. To find a percentage of a number, I can multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the number. So, 120% as a decimal is 1.2. Therefore, 1.2 multiplied by 30 should give me the first value. Let me calculate that: 1.2 * 30. Hmm, 1 times 30 is 30, and 0.2 times 30 is 6, so adding those together gives me 36. Okay, so 120% of 30 is 36.\n\nNext, I need to find 130% of 20. Again, converting 130% to a decimal is 1.3. So, 1.3 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 1 times 20 is 20, and 0.3 times 20 is 6, so adding those together gives me 26. So, 130% of 20 is 26.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the positive difference between these two values. The positive difference is just the absolute value of their difference, right? So, I need to subtract the smaller number from the larger one and take the positive result. Let me subtract 26 from 36: 36 - 26 equals 10. Since 10 is positive, that's my answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 120% of 30: 1.2 * 30. 1.2 times 30 is indeed 36 because 10% of 30 is 3, so 100% is 30, and 20% is 6, so 30 + 6 is 36. That seems right.\n\nFor 130% of 20: 1.3 * 20. 10% of 20 is 2, so 100% is 20, and 30% is 6, so 20 + 6 is 26. That also seems correct.\n\nSubtracting 26 from 36 gives 10. So, the positive difference is 10. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. It all adds up.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it another way to verify. Maybe using fractions instead of decimals. Let's see.\n\n120% is the same as 120/100, which simplifies to 6/5. So, 6/5 of 30 is (6/5)*30. Let me compute that: 6*30 is 180, divided by 5 is 36. Yep, same result.\n\n130% is 130/100, which simplifies to 13/10. So, 13/10 of 20 is (13/10)*20. That's 13*2, which is 26. Again, same as before.\n\nSubtracting 26 from 36 gives 10. So, regardless of whether I use decimals or fractions, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 10 is the correct positive difference.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is to consider how much each percentage contributes to the total. For 120% of 30, it's 120 per 100, so for every 100 units, it's 120. But since we're dealing with 30, it's 120*(30/100) = 36. Similarly, 130% of 20 is 130*(20/100) = 26. So, the difference is 36 - 2",

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem: Find x such that the ceiling of x plus x equals 23/7. I need to express x as a common fraction. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the ceiling function, denoted by \u23a1x\u23a4, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. So, if x is not an integer, the ceiling of x will be the next integer. If x is an integer, then the ceiling of x is just x itself.\n\nSo, the equation is \u23a1x\u23a4 + x = 23/7. Let me write that down:\n\n\u23a1x\u23a4 + x = 23/7.\n\nI need to find x. Let me denote n = \u23a1x\u23a4. Since n is the ceiling of x, n must be an integer, and x must satisfy n - 1 < x \u2264 n. That is, x is greater than n - 1 but less than or equal to n.\n\nSo, substituting n into the equation, we have:\n\nn + x = 23/7.\n\nBut since n is an integer, and x is a real number, I can express x as x = 23/7 - n.\n\nBut x must also satisfy n - 1 < x \u2264 n. So, substituting x from above:\n\nn - 1 < 23/7 - n \u2264 n.\n\nLet me write that as two inequalities:\n\n1. n - 1 < 23/7 - n\n2. 23/7 - n \u2264 n\n\nLet me solve the first inequality:\n\nn - 1 < 23/7 - n\n\nAdding n to both sides:\n\n2n - 1 < 23/7\n\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n\n2n < 23/7 + 1\n\nConvert 1 to 7/7:\n\n2n < 23/7 + 7/7 = 30/7\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nn < 15/7 \u2248 2.142857\n\nSince n is an integer, n must be less than 15/7, so n \u2264 2.\n\nNow, let's solve the second inequality:\n\n23/7 - n \u2264 n\n\nAdding n to both sides:\n\n23/7 \u2264 2n\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n23/14 \u2264 n\n\n23/14 is approximately 1.642857.\n\nSince n is an integer, n must be greater than or equal to 2.\n\nSo, combining both inequalities:\n\nn \u2264 2 and n \u2265 2.\n\nTherefore, n must be exactly 2.\n\nSo, n = 2.\n\nNow, substitute back into x = 23/7 - n:\n\nx = 23/7 - 2.\n\nConvert 2 to 14/7:\n\nx = 23/7 - 14/7 = 9/7.\n\nWait, so x is 9/7. Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nFirst, compute \u23a1x\u23a4. Since x is 9/7, which is approximately 1.2857, the ceiling of x is 2.\n\nSo, \u23a1x\u23a4 + x = 2 + 9/7.\n\nConvert 2 to 14/7:\n\n14/7 + 9/7 = 23/7.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, x = 9/7 is the solution.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other possible values for n. Earlier, I found that n must be 2 because n has to be an integer between 1.642857 and 2.142857. So, n can only be 2. Therefore, x must be 9/7.\n\nIs 9/7 a common fraction? Yes, it's already a common fraction. So, that should be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that x is between n - 1 and n, so x = n - 1 + f, where 0 < f \u2264 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nn + (n - 1 + f) = 23/7.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2n - 1 + f = 23/7.\n\nSo, 2n + f = 23/7 + 1 = 30/7.\n\nTherefore, 2n + f = 30/7.\n\nBut since n is an integer, 2n is an",

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem to solve: evaluate \\(i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45}\\). Hmm, I remember that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, where \\(i^2 = -1\\). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact powers of \\(i\\), so let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four exponents. That is, \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), \\(i^4 = 1\\), and then it repeats: \\(i^5 = i\\), \\(i^6 = -1\\), and so on. So, if I can find the remainder when the exponent is divided by 4, I can determine the value of \\(i\\) raised to that exponent.\n\nLet me start with \\(i^5\\). Dividing 5 by 4 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1. So, \\(i^5 = i^{4 + 1} = (i^4)(i^1) = 1 \\times i = i\\). That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, \\(i^{-25}\\). Hmm, negative exponents. I remember that \\(i^{-n} = \\frac{1}{i^n}\\). So, \\(i^{-25} = \\frac{1}{i^{25}}\\). But calculating \\(i^{25}\\) directly might be tricky. Maybe I can find the remainder when 25 is divided by 4. Let's see, 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. So, \\(i^{25} = i^{4 \\times 6 + 1} = (i^4)^6 \\times i^1 = 1^6 \\times i = i\\). Therefore, \\(i^{-25} = \\frac{1}{i}\\).\n\nWait, but \\(\\frac{1}{i}\\) is a bit confusing. I think I can rationalize the denominator. Multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(i\\), we get \\(\\frac{1 \\times i}{i \\times i} = \\frac{i}{i^2} = \\frac{i}{-1} = -i\\). So, \\(i^{-25} = -i\\). That makes sense because \\(i^{-1} = -i\\), so \\(i^{-25}\\) is just \\(i^{-1}\\) raised to the 25th power, which is \\((-i)^{25}\\). Since 25 is odd, that would be \\(-i\\). Yeah, that checks out.\n\nNow, moving on to \\(i^{45}\\). Again, using the cycle every four exponents. Let's divide 45 by 4. 45 divided by 4 is 11 with a remainder of 1. So, \\(i^{45} = i^{4 \\times 11 + 1} = (i^4)^{11} \\times i^1 = 1^{11} \\times i = i\\). So, \\(i^{45} = i\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the expression becomes \\(i + (-i) + i\\). Let me compute that step by step. First, \\(i + (-i)\\) is \\(0\\), because they are additive inverses. Then, adding \\(i\\) to that result: \\(0 + i = i\\). So, the total is \\(i\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with \\(i^5\\): 5 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 1, so \\(i^5 = i^1 = i\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(i^{-25}\\): 25 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 1, so \\(i^{25} = i^1 = i\\). Therefore, \\(i^{-25} = 1/i = -i\\). That seems right because \\(1/i = -i\\).\n\nAnd \\(i^{45}\\): 45 divided by 4 is 11 with remainder 1, so \\(i^{45} = i^1 = i\\). So, adding them up: \\(i + (-i) + i = i - i + i = 0 + i = i\\). Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I did everything right. So, the final answer should be \\(i\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(i^5 + i^{-25} +",

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: If \\(2^8 = 4^x\\), what is the value of \\(x\\)? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that exponents can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I rewrite them with the same base, it'll make things easier.\n\nFirst, I know that 4 is a power of 2. Specifically, 4 is equal to \\(2^2\\). So, maybe I can express both sides of the equation with base 2. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the right side of the equation: \\(4^x\\). Since 4 is \\(2^2\\), I can rewrite \\(4^x\\) as \\((2^2)^x\\). Now, I remember that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, \\((2^2)^x\\) becomes \\(2^{2x}\\). That simplifies the equation a bit.\n\nNow, the equation is \\(2^8 = 2^{2x}\\). Since the bases are the same and the equation holds true, the exponents must be equal. That means I can set the exponents equal to each other: 8 equals \\(2x\\).\n\nSo, \\(8 = 2x\\). To solve for \\(x\\), I just need to divide both sides by 2. Let me do that: \\(8 \u00f7 2 = x\\), which simplifies to \\(4 = x\\). So, \\(x\\) is 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug \\(x = 4\\) back into the original equation, does it hold true?\n\nOriginal equation: \\(2^8 = 4^x\\). Let's compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: \\(2^8\\). I know that \\(2^8\\) is 256 because \\(2^4 = 16\\), \\(2^5 = 32\\), \\(2^6 = 64\\), \\(2^7 = 128\\), and \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\nRight side: \\(4^4\\). Since 4 is \\(2^2\\), \\(4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^{2*4} = 2^8\\), which is also 256. So, both sides are equal, which means \\(x = 4\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I converted the equation to the same base, set the exponents equal, solved for \\(x\\), and then verified by plugging it back in. Everything checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is by using logarithms. If I take the logarithm of both sides, I can solve for \\(x\\). Let's try that method to confirm.\n\nStarting with \\(2^8 = 4^x\\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: \\(\\ln(2^8) = \\ln(4^x)\\). Using the logarithm power rule, which says \\(\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)\\), I can rewrite both sides.\n\nLeft side: \\(8\\ln(2)\\). Right side: \\(x\\ln(4)\\). So, the equation becomes \\(8\\ln(2) = x\\ln(4)\\). To solve for \\(x\\), divide both sides by \\(\\ln(4)\\): \\(x = \\frac{8\\ln(2)}{\\ln(4)}\\).\n\nNow, I know that \\(\\ln(4)\\) is the same as \\(\\ln(2^2)\\), which is \\(2\\ln(2)\\). So, substituting that in, we have \\(x = \\frac{8\\ln(2)}{2\\ln(2)}\\). The \\(\\ln(2)\\) terms cancel out, leaving \\(x = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\\). So, again, \\(x = 4\\).\n\nThis method also gives the same answer, so it's consistent. I think that's pretty thorough. I considered two different methods: one by expressing both sides with the same base and another by using logarithms. Both led me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that \\(x = 4\\) is correct.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing powers of 4 in terms of 2. Since 4 is \\(2^2\\), and 8 is \\(2^3\\), perhaps I can express both sides as powers of 2 with exponents that are multiples of",
