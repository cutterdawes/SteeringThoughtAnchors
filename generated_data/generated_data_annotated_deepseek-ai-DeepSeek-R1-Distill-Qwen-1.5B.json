At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many vertical asymptotes the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has. Hmm, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, right? Because the function will approach infinity or negative infinity as it gets close to those x-values. So, I should start by finding the roots of the denominator.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\). To find its roots, I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first because it might be quicker. I need two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Let's see, 3 and -2: 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as \\( (x + 3)(x - 2) \\).\n\nTherefore, the denominator is zero when \\( x + 3 = 0 \\) or \\( x - 2 = 0 \\), which gives x = -3 and x = 2. So, the function has vertical asymptotes at x = -3 and x = 2. That means there are two vertical asymptotes.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I plug x = -3 into the denominator, it becomes \\( (-3)^2 + (-3) - 6 = 9 - 3 - 6 = 0 \\). Similarly, for x = 2, it's \\( 2^2 + 2 - 6 = 4 + 2 - 6 = 0 \\). Yep, both are zeros of the denominator, so vertical asymptotes at these points.\n\nIs there any other possibility? Maybe I should consider if the numerator and denominator share any common factors, which could lead to holes instead of asymptotes. The numerator is just 2, which doesn't factor into anything. So, no, there are no common factors, meaning both x = -3 and x = 2 are indeed vertical asymptotes.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has two vertical asymptotes at x = -3 and x = 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe graph has \\boxed{2} vertical asymptotes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many vertical asymptotes the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has, we need to find the roots of the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\).\n\nFirst, we factor the quadratic equation:\n\\[ x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe roots of the denominator are found by setting each factor equal to zero:\n\\[ x + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3 \\]\n\\[ x - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2 \\]\n\nSince the numerator is 2, which does not share any common factors with the denominator, both \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\) are vertical asymptotes.\n\nThus, the graph has \\boxed{2} vertical asymptotes.",

        "gt_solution": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.
