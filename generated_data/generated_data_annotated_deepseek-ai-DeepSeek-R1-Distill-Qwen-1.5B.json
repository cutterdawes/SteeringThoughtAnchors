And I need to find the value of b when a is 4. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a linear equation, which is 3x plus 2y equals 12. This equation represents a straight line on a coordinate plane. The point (a, b) is somewhere on this line. Since a is 4, I need to find the corresponding value of b that satisfies both the equation of the line and the coordinates (4, b).\n\nSo, I think the key here is to substitute the value of a into the equation and solve for b. That makes sense because if (a, b) is on the line, plugging in a should give me the correct y-value, which is b in this case.\n\nLet me write down the equation again to keep it clear: 3x + 2y = 12.\n\nSince a is 4, and the point is (a, b), that means x is 4,",
