Hmm, let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.\n\nFirst, the problem is asking for 50% of (1/3 of 36). That sounds like two separate operations: first, find 1/3 of 36, and then take 50% of that result. I think that's right because the phrase \"of\" usually indicates multiplication. So, maybe I can solve it by doing two multiplication steps.\n\nLet me start by calculating 1/3 of 36. So, 1/3 of 36 is the same as (1/3) * 36. Hmm, I know that dividing by 3 and multiplying by 1 is the same as multiplying by 1/3. So, 36 divided by 3 is... let me compute that. 3 goes into 36 twelve times because 3 times 12 is 36. So, 1/3 of 36 is 12. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the next step is to find 50",
