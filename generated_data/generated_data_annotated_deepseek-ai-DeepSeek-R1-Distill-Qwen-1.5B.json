Hmm, okay. I remember that arithmetic sequences have a common difference between consecutive terms. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the common difference. The first term is 6, the second is 10, so the difference between them is 10 - 6 = 4. Let me check the next ones to make sure. 14 - 10 is also 4, and 18 - 14 is 4. So, yeah, the common difference, which I think is usually denoted as 'd', is 4. That's good to know.\n\nNow, I need to find the 100th term. I recall that the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is something like a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Let me make sure I got that right. So, a_1 is the first term, which is 6, and d is the common difference, which is 4. So, plugging in, the formula becomes a_n = 6 + (n - 1)*4.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula. If n is 1, then a_1 = 6 + (1 - 1)*4 = 6 + 0 = 6, which is correct. For n = 2, a_2 = 6 + (2 - 1)*4 = 6 + 4 = 10, which matches the given sequence. Similarly, for n = 3, a_3 = 6 + (3 - 1)*4 = 6 + 8 = 14, and so on. So, the formula seems to be correct.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the 100th term, which means I plug in n = 100 into the formula. Let's write that out: a_100 = 6 + (100 - 1)*4. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate (100 - 1), which is 99. Then multiply that by 4: 99 * 4. Hmm, let me compute",

Piecewise functions can be a bit tricky because they have different expressions depending on the value of x. I remember that to evaluate a piecewise function at a specific point, I need to determine which piece to use based on the value of that x.\n\nLooking at the function, it's defined as:\n\nf(x) = \n3x + 5, if x < -3,\n7 - 4x, if x \u2265 -3.\n\nOkay, so the function has two parts. The first part, 3x + 5, is used when x is less than -3. The second part, 7 - 4x, is used when x is greater than or equal to -3. \n\nI need to find f(-10). Let me check where -10 falls in relation to -3. Hmm, -10 is less than -3 because -10 is to the left of -3 on the number line. So that means I should use the first part of the function, which is 3x + 5.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the inequalities. The first case is x < -3, so -10 is definitely less than -3. So, yeah, I should plug x = -10 into 3x + 5.\n\nLet me write that down: f(-10) = 3*(-10) + 5. Okay, so 3 times -10 is -30, and then adding 5 to that would be -30 + 5, which is -25.\n\nHmm, is that it? Seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the function is defined differently for x < -3 and x \u2265 -3. Since -10 is less than -3, I definitely use the first part. Plugging in x = -10 into 3x + 5, so 3*(-10) is -30, plus 5 is -25. That seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, what if I tried using the second part of the function? Let me see, if I plug x = -10 into 7 - 4x, that would be 7 - ",

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to evaluate the product of four cube roots. It's written as \u221a[3]{12} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{20} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{15} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{60}. Hmm, cube roots multiplied together. I remember that when you multiply radicals, there's a property that allows you to combine them under a single radical. Is that right?\n\nLet me recall. For square roots, the property is \u221aa \u00d7 \u221ab = \u221a(a\u00d7b). Maybe it's similar for cube roots? So, if I have \u221a[3]{a} \u00d7 \u221a[3]{b} = \u221a[3]{a\u00d7b}. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, applying that to this problem, I can multiply all the numbers inside the cube roots together.\n\nSo, first step: multiply 12, 20, 15, and 60. Let me write that down.\n\n12 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 60.\n\nHmm, that seems like a lot of multiplication. Maybe I can simplify this step by step. Let me factor each number into its prime factors. That might make it easier to multiply and then see if I can simplify the cube root.\n\nStarting with 12: that's 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3, so 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3.\n\n20: that's 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\n15: that's 3 \u00d7 5.\n\n60: that's 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nSo, writing all together:\n\n12 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\n20 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\n15 = 3 \u00d7 5\n60 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\n\nNow, multiplying them all together:\n\n(2\u00b2 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (2\u00b2 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 (2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5)\n\nLet me group the like terms:\n\nFor the 2s: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 2\u00b2 \u00d7 2\u00b2.

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a merry-go-round. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a merry-go-round, which is like a circular platform, right? It's got a center point, and then horses (or riders) sitting on it at different distances from that center. The problem says that a horse is 64 feet from the center and makes 27 revolutions. I need to figure out how many revolutions another horse, sitting 16 feet from the center, would need to make in order to travel the same distance as the first horse.\n\nHmm, okay. So, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with circular motion, the distance traveled in one revolution is the circumference of the circle. The circumference is calculated by the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius or the distance from the center.\n\nSo, for the first horse, which is 64 feet from the center, the circumference would be 2\u03c0 times 64. Let me write that down: C1 = 2\u03c0 * 64. That's 128\u03c0 feet per revolution. Since it makes 27 revolutions, the total distance it travels is 128\u03c0 multiplied by 27. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, maybe I should keep it symbolic for now instead of computing the exact number. So, the total distance D1 is C1 * number of revolutions, which is (2\u03c0 * 64) * 27. That simplifies to 2\u03c0 * 64 * 27.\n\nNow, for the second horse, it's sitting 16 feet from the center. So, its circumference is C2 = 2\u03c0 * 16. Let me calculate that: 32\u03c0 feet per revolution. Let's denote the number of revolutions it needs to make as N. So, the total distance D2 is C2 * N, which is 32\u03c0 * N.\n\nSince the problem says both horses travel the same distance, D1 must equal D2. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n2\u03c0 * 64 * 27 = 32\u03c0 * N\n\nHmm, let me write that out:\n\n2\u03c0 * 64 * 27 = 32\u03c0 * N\n\nI notice that \u03c0 appears on both sides of the equation, so I can divide both",

How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?\n\nThink carefully and show your reasoning. At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about twelve people buying supplies for a ten-day camping trip. They think each person gets an equal number of supplies each day. Then, they get three more people, making it twelve plus three, which is fifteen people in total. But they don't buy any more supplies. The question is, how many days will the supplies last if each person still gets their original share?\n\nAlright, let me try to break this down. First, I need to figure out how much each person is getting per day in terms of supplies. Then, with the new total number of people, I can see how much longer the supplies will last.\n\nSo, originally, twelve people are buying supplies for a ten-day trip. That means the total amount of supplies is enough for 12 people for 10 days. If I let the total number of supplies be something like, say, 120 units, just to make the numbers easier, but actually, maybe I can solve it without assigning a specific number.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of units. Let me denote the total number of supplies as S. Each person is supposed to get an equal share each day. So, originally, each person would get S divided by 12, right? Because there are twelve people, so each person gets S/12 per day.\n\nNow, when they join three more people, the total number of people becomes 15. But the amount of supplies hasn't changed, it's still S. So, now each person will get S divided by 15 per day, because there are fifteen people instead of twelve.\n\nSo, the question is, how many days will the supplies last with this new rate. Let me denote the number of days as D. So, the total amount of supplies can also be expressed as 15 people multiplied by the new daily share. So, S = 15 * (S/15). Wait, that seems redundant because if you multiply 15 by S/15, you get S. But that's just confirming that the total supplies are still S.\n\nBut I think I need a different approach. Maybe I can set up an equation. Let's see. Originally, the supplies last for 10 days for 12 people. So, the total supplies can be calculated as 12 people * 10 days * daily share. So, S =",

Hmm, let me see. I think I should start by understanding the function better.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right: \\( f(x) = (x-1)(x-3)(x-7)(x-9) \\). So, it's a quartic polynomial because it's a product of four linear terms. That means it's a fourth-degree polynomial, and its graph should have four roots at x = 1, 3, 7, and 9. So, it's going to cross the x-axis at these points.\n\nNow, I need to find \\( f(6) \\) and \\( f(4) \\) and then subtract them. Maybe I can compute each value separately and then subtract. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without expanding all the terms, which could save some time.\n\nLet me try computing \\( f(6) \\) first. Plugging in 6 into the function:\n\n\\( f(6) = (6 - 1)(6 - 3)(6 - 7)(6 - 9) \\)\n\nLet me compute each part step by step:\n\n1. \\( 6 - 1 = 5 \\)\n2. \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n3. \\( 6 - 7 = -1 \\)\n4. \\( 6 - 9 = -3 \\)\n\nSo, multiplying these together: \\( 5 * 3 = 15 \\), then \\( -1 * -3 = 3 \\).

At the end, provide the final answer enclosed in \\boxed{}.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here: the combined weight of three basset hounds is 185 pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds. I need to find how many pounds the largest dog weighs. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are three basset hounds. Two of them are smaller and weigh the same, so they have equal weights. The third one is larger, and the difference between this larger one and the smaller ones is 20 pounds. The total weight of all three is 185 pounds. So, I need to find the weight of the largest dog.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the weight of each smaller dog is 'x' pounds. Since there are two smaller dogs, together they weigh 2x pounds. The larger dog, let's call its weight 'y' pounds. \n\nSo, according to the problem, the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds. That means y - x = 20. Okay, that's one equation.\n\nAlso, the combined weight of all three dogs is 185 pounds. So, 2x (for the two smaller dogs) plus y (for the largest one) equals 185. So, another equation: 2x + y = 185.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. y - x = 20\n2. 2x + y = 185\n\nI need to solve this system to find the value of y, which is the weight of the largest dog.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1. y = x + 20 (from the first equation)\n2. 2x + y = 185\n\nSo, if I substitute the first equation into the second one, I can solve for x. Let's do that.\n\nSubstitute y from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n2x + (x + 20) = 185\n\nSimplify that:\n\n2x + x + 20 = 185\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x + 20 = 185\n\nNow, subtract 20 from both sides:\n\n3",
        "cot": "Alright, so I have this problem here: the combined weight of three basset hounds is 185 pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds. I need to find how many pounds the largest dog weighs. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are three basset hounds. Two of them are smaller and weigh the same, so they have equal weights. The third one is larger, and the difference between this larger one and the smaller ones is 20 pounds. The total weight of all three is 185 pounds. So, I need to find the weight of the largest dog.\n\nLet me assign some variables to make this clearer. Let's say the weight of each smaller dog is 'x' pounds. Since there are two smaller dogs, together they weigh 2x pounds. The larger dog, let's call its weight 'y' pounds. \n\nSo, according to the problem, the difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is 20 pounds. That means y - x = 20. Okay, that's one equation.\n\nAlso, the combined weight of all three dogs is 185 pounds. So, 2x (for the two smaller dogs) plus y (for the largest one) equals 185.

We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+b&=185\\\\\nb-a&=20\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $a=b-20$. Substituting this in to the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $2(b-20)+b=185 \\Rightarrow b=75$. Thus, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds.",
